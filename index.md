## Blog 4: Crowdsourcing 

Week 5
07/26/2019



In a Los Angeles Times article called “Op-Ed: Your job is about to get ‘taskified’”, Mary L. Gray said “Forget the rise of robots and the distant threat of automation. The immediate issue is the Uber-izing of human labor, fragmenting of jobs into outsourced tasks and dismantling of wages into micropayments.” Where she then backs up her argument by explaining crowdsourcing and how it can affect us.

Crowdsourcing is when large companies or organizations gain services and goods from a large group of internet users that are not employed in said company. Reading the article made me realize the issues that could occur in crowd work; as in most of the time, there’s no legal binding agreement between the individual and the company that protects the worker’s rights such as the labor laws found in many states. Subsequently, that would lead to many disagreements between the parties where one or the other (usually the worker) will suffer with no laws or rights to protect him. 

Riyaz Khan’s experience with crowdsourcing is a perfect example of the how unjust this new system could be without the proper regulations. Khan and his team were finding work on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). AMT is an online marketplace that connects individuals (online users) with companies and organizations that want to get work done. In the span of three years, Khan and his team managed to get a steady income that can support their families and friends and depended on it; meaning that this is their only flow of income.

Suddenly, word got out that some Indian workers’ AMT accounts were suspended. Shortly after, one of Khan’s team members got his account suspended, and it didn’t take long till everyone in the team lost their accounts and the money in the account with no proper justification from AMT. Khan contacted the company’s customer service multiple times with no avail, just like his team members. And they no one could do anything about this as there’s no laws that protect Khan and his team’s rights. Six months later, Khan got his final pay check without any explanations, while other members still can’t get their money back with no way of even legally pursuing their rights.

I believe that Khan and his team’s experience with crowdsourcing should encourage everyone to fight for a regulated controlled system that protects both the company’s and the individual’s rights; as if done correctly, crowdsourcing can be hugely beneficial to both parties and the future of the world as a whole.

## Blog 3: Website Analysis
Week 4
07/17/2019



   This week marks one of the first steps towards my research in analyzing a website’s history and the changes that occurred throughout the years. For this research, I have used Apple.com as the subject to be explored and studied.
The site was examined in three different stages of its 23 years’ timeline (1996-2019).

	
   To start this study, I went and searched for ways to extract a website’s history, and I found out “The internet Archive”. It’s basically a huge digital archive of an enormous number of snapshots taken of different websites at different times. So basically, bots would visit as much sites as it could and take a snapshot of it; so, it can be saved in the archive for everyone to access it.

   I then took some screenshots of Apple’s site in the three different stages (1996, 2006, 2019) and started analyzing all of its features, such as the font, buttons, and navigation bar. I have then started connecting the dots between the changes happening in these different snapshots, to the “DesignX: complex sociotechnical systems.” Article. Where it discusses the issues and solutions that many large-scale improvements suffer from, and I believe that these issues are represented in Apple’s site history but in a smaller more discreet manner.


   And it turns out, people don’t prefer special effects or styles when they’re browsing the web. As many sites’ histories show us, people just want simple, flat, easy on the eye design. But the question remains, what will people want another 20 years from now?

## Blog 2: Education and Technology
Week 2
07/03/2019



 
   In describing our current education system, Theodor H. Nelson said: “Material is dumped on the students and their responses calibrated; their interaction and involvements with the material is not encouraged nor taken into consideration, but their dutifulness of response is carefully monitored” Stating that this issue is limiting students’ creativity by not allowing him to choose the materials he genuinely wants to study and exceed in. On the other hand, some people are countering his argument by saying that students need to have some knowledge in all areas; as they might discover later on an unfound passion or love to a subject he didn’t even know a couple of years back.


   Nelson suggests that: “Instead of devising elaborate systems permitting the computer or its instructional contents to control the situation, why not permit the student to control the system, show him how to do so intelligently, and make it easy for him to find his own way?”. As he implies that schools or even computer programs and courses are similar to a brick wall obstructing the student from the subject and the way he gains information from said subject. And he has backed up his argument by using this illustration:

   While reading Nelson’s book, I have noticed that from 1974 he has been advocating the use of hyper-media in our education system as a way to give students more freedom and a new improved way of learning. Yet, I still believe that there is a lack of hyper-media and technology incorporated ways of teaching in our current education system. Many schools are still teaching students the same way they were taught 60 years ago, why is that? Is it because of the complexity of technology against the old ways? Or is it the lack of educational software available right now?


   In my opinion, I believe that our current education system does not need a complete overhaul, instead it needs to integrate hyper-media and other ways of online learning, as well as giving the students more freedom (like choosing his subjects and the way he wants to study it) especially in high-school. And I think that this solution offers a middle ground between the two groups, and at the same time enhance or improve upon our cuurent system.

## Blog 1: The Telegraph
Week 1
06/27/2019



  Could you ever believe that our world would be free of hostilities and wars, that the whole world will be living in peace? Well, that is what most of the people thought upon the introduction of the Telegraph. And honestly, it actually makes sense. Because back then the idea of being able to transmit information and facts to everyone in a fast manner, no matter how far they are, was ground-breaking. Yet, to this day we are in a constant state of warfare. So, what did we do wrong?

   Surprise! we did nothing wrong. After reading “The Master Switch” I have realized that this is a common cycle that happens to pretty much every brand new revolutionary product or service. Here is how the cycle goes:  the new product or service is unveiled to the public, everyone is shocked and can’t believe that this is real (here is the part where people start saying how this will flip the whole world and eliminate each and every one of its issues.). Then, the generation growing up in the same time will invest their time and life on studying and improving the ground-breaking product, after a while they’ll find many flaws and start ditching the product for better alternatives and newer technologies, thus; the cycle continues.

  After reading “The Master Switch” I decided to get to know more about the Telegraph. Therefore, I read an article called “Technology and Ideology”. In this article, the author criticizes the scholars and academics who haven’t given the Telegraph it’s right. And to counter that, the author detailed both the history of the telegraph and how it has affected us and our ideology. Upon reading this article, I have discovered many new and interesting facts about the history of the telegraph. I have summarized these facts in the following points:

-	The Telegraph changed the way information is transmitted.
-	It was thought that the telegraph would bring peace on our world and stop hostilities.
-	The Telegraph was first used to play long distance chess.
-	The Telegraph has affected many industries, sometimes in the most extreme and simple ways (train track / arriving ships).
-	The Telegraph had its most impactful effect on commerce, government, and military.
-	The Telegraph uniformed the prices of basic merchandise between cities and states.
-	The Telegraph coordinated the industrial nation via the grid of time.

   All in all, I was amazed and honestly shocked after reading and studying the Telegraph 
and comprehending its humungous impact on our society, ideology, and on the future of all communication devices. On the other hand, the cycle of new products was a real eye-opener. It has changed the way I perceive the world and future; as whenever I see or hear about a new product, I can’t help but start thinking about what will happen after the end of this cycle, how will the next new technology change our world? And so on with the cycle after that.
