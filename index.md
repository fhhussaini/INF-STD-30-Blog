   In describing our current education system, Theodor H. Nelson said: “Material is dumped on the students and their responses calibrated; their interaction and involvements with the material is not encouraged nor taken into consideration, but their dutifulness of response is carefully monitored” Stating that this issue is limiting students’ creativity by not allowing him to choose the materials he genuinely wants to study and exceed in. On the other hand, some people are countering his argument by saying that students need to have some knowledge in all areas; as they might discover later on an unfound passion or love to a subject he didn’t even know a couple of years back.


   Nelson suggests that: “Instead of devising elaborate systems permitting the computer or its instructional contents to control the situation, why not permit the student to control the system, show him how to do so intelligently, and make it easy for him to find his own way?”. As he implies that schools or even computer programs and courses are similar to a brick wall obstructing the student from the subject and the way he gains information from said subject. And he has backed up his argument by using this illustration:

   While reading Nelson’s book, I have noticed that from 1974 he has been advocating the use of hyper-media in our education system as a way to give students more freedom and a new improved way of learning. Yet, I still believe that there is a lack of hyper-media and technology incorporated ways of teaching in our current education system. Many schools are still teaching students the same way they were taught 60 years ago, why is that? Is it because of the complexity of technology against the old ways? Or is it the lack of educational software available right now?


   In my opinion, I believe that our current education system does not need a complete overhaul, instead it needs to integrate hyper-media and other ways of online learning, as well as giving the students more freedom (like choosing his subjects and the way he wants to study it) especially in high-school. And I think that this solution offers a middle ground between the two groups, and at the same time enhance or improve upon our cuurent system.

## Blog 1: The Telegraph
Week 1
06/27/2019



  Could you ever believe that our world would be free of hostilities and wars, that the whole world will be living in peace? Well, that is what most of the people thought upon the introduction of the Telegraph. And honestly, it actually makes sense. Because back then the idea of being able to transmit information and facts to everyone in a fast manner, no matter how far they are, was ground-breaking. Yet, to this day we are in a constant state of warfare. So, what did we do wrong?

   Surprise! we did nothing wrong. After reading “The Master Switch” I have realized that this is a common cycle that happens to pretty much every brand new revolutionary product or service. Here is how the cycle goes:  the new product or service is unveiled to the public, everyone is shocked and can’t believe that this is real (here is the part where people start saying how this will flip the whole world and eliminate each and every one of its issues.). Then, the generation growing up in the same time will invest their time and life on studying and improving the ground-breaking product, after a while they’ll find many flaws and start ditching the product for better alternatives and newer technologies, thus; the cycle continues.

  After reading “The Master Switch” I decided to get to know more about the Telegraph. Therefore, I read an article called “Technology and Ideology”. In this article, the author criticizes the scholars and academics who haven’t given the Telegraph it’s right. And to counter that, the author detailed both the history of the telegraph and how it has affected us and our ideology. Upon reading this article, I have discovered many new and interesting facts about the history of the telegraph. I have summarized these facts in the following points:

-	The Telegraph changed the way information is transmitted.
-	It was thought that the telegraph would bring peace on our world and stop hostilities.
-	The Telegraph was first used to play long distance chess.
-	The Telegraph has affected many industries, sometimes in the most extreme and simple ways (train track / arriving ships).
-	The Telegraph had its most impactful effect on commerce, government, and military.
-	The Telegraph uniformed the prices of basic merchandise between cities and states.
-	The Telegraph coordinated the industrial nation via the grid of time.

   All in all, I was amazed and honestly shocked after reading and studying the Telegraph 
and comprehending its humungous impact on our society, ideology, and on the future of all communication devices. On the other hand, the cycle of new products was a real eye-opener. It has changed the way I perceive the world and future; as whenever I see or hear about a new product, I can’t help but start thinking about what will happen after the end of this cycle, how will the next new technology change our world? And so on with the cycle after that.
