## Blog 1: The Telegraph



Could you ever believe that our world would be free of hostilities and wars, that the whole world will be living in peace? Well, that is what most of the people thought upon the introduction of the Telegraph. And honestly, it actually makes sense. Because back then the idea of being able to transmit information and facts to everyone in a fast manner, no matter how far they are, was ground-breaking. Yet, to this day we are in a constant state of warfare. So, what did we do wrong?

Surprise! we did nothing wrong. After reading “The Master Switch” I have realized that this is a common cycle that happens to pretty much every brand new revolutionary product or service. Here is how the cycle goes:  the new product or service is unveiled to the public, everyone is shocked and can’t believe that this is real (here is the part where people start saying how this will flip the whole world and eliminate each and every one of its issues.). Then, the generation growing up in the same time will invest their time and life on studying and improving the ground-breaking product, after a while they’ll find many flaws and start ditching the product for better alternatives and newer technologies, thus; the cycle continues.

After reading “The Master Switch” I decided to get to know more about the Telegraph. Therefore, I read an article called “Technology and Ideology”. In this article, the author criticizes the scholars and academics who haven’t given the Telegraph it’s right. And to counter that, the author detailed both the history of the telegraph and how it has affected us and our ideology. Upon reading this article, I have discovered many new and interesting facts about the history of the telegraph. I have summarized these facts in the following points:

-	The Telegraph changed the way information is transmitted.
-	It was thought that the telegraph would bring peace on our world and stop hostilities.
-	The Telegraph was first used to play long distance chess.
-	The Telegraph has affected many industries, sometimes in the most extreme and simple ways (train track / arriving ships).
-	The Telegraph had its most impactful effect on commerce, government, and military.
-	The Telegraph uniformed the prices of basic merchandise between cities and states.
-	The Telegraph coordinated the industrial nation via the grid of time.

All in all, I was amazed and honestly shocked after reading and studying the Telegraph 
and comprehending its humungous impact on our society, ideology, and on the future of all communication devices.
